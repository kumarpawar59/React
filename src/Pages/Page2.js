          Parallel structures are created by constructing two or more phrases or
          sentences that have the same grammatical structure and use the same
          parts of speech. By creating parallel structures you make your sentences
          clearer and easier to read. In addition, repeating a pattern in a series
          of consecutive sentences helps your reader see the connections between
          ideas. In the paragraph above about scientists and the sense of sight,
          several sentences in the body of the paragraph have been constructed in
          a parallel way. The parallel structures (which have been emphasized)
          help the reader see that the paragraph is organized as a set of examples
          of a general statement.
